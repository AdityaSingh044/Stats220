# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Commerce & Science.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I have always struggled with coding and really want to improve.
- I am interested in learning about data visualisation techniques and how to maximise resourcefulness out of R studio.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif)
